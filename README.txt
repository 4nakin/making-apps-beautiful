The following Android Studio project contains ten source modules, each acting as a checkpoint. Here's how to get started:
* Launch Android Studio
* Go to "Import Project"
* Select build.gradle from the root directory of this repository.
* On the "Import Project from Gradle" dialog, ensure that "Use gradle wrapper (recommended)" is selected and leave the rest to default values.
* The import can take a couple of minutes.
* After the project has been created, Android Studio may encounter an IllegalStateException which can be safely ignored.
* The project is now ready.
* Each module represents a checkpoint, the details of which are described in the src/main/README.txt
